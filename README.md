## SMART FISH DRYER WITH RAIN DETECTION SYSTEM BASED ON FUZZY LOGIC CONTROL

## Introduction
Sun-drying has been a traditional method of food preservation for generations, passed down through cultural practices. It effectively preserves various perishable goods, including vegetables and meats, by removing moisture and preventing spoilage caused by germs. This method offers several advantages, such as making food lightweight and easy to transport, requiring less energy compared to freezing or canning, and minimizing storage space requirements. Additionally, the nutritional value of the dried food is minimally affected. Sun-drying continues to be widely used for various purposes, including drying clothes in households, materials in industries, and crops and fish in agriculture. In the Philippines, with its abundant agricultural and aquatic resources, sun-drying, especially of fish, is common practice despite being prone to typhoons due to its tropical location near the equator.
