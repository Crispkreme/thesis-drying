## SMART FISH DRYER WITH RAIN DETECTION SYSTEM BASED ON FUZZY LOGIC CONTROL

## Introduction
Sun-drying has been a traditional method of food preservation for generations, passed down through cultural practices. It effectively preserves various perishable goods, including vegetables and meats, by removing moisture and preventing spoilage caused by germs. This method offers several advantages, such as making food lightweight and easy to transport, requiring less energy compared to freezing or canning, and minimizing storage space requirements. Additionally, the nutritional value of the dried food is minimally affected. Sun-drying continues to be widely used for various purposes, including drying clothes in households, materials in industries, and crops and fish in agriculture. In the Philippines, with its abundant agricultural and aquatic resources, sun-drying, especially of fish, is common practice despite being prone to typhoons due to its tropical location near the equator.

## Problem Statement
Fish drying is a widely used preservation method in coastal regions, but it is often disrupted by rainfall, affecting drying time, product quality, and efficiency. The absence of a reliable rain detection and mitigation system results in significant losses and subpar drying results. Hence, there is a need to create a fuzzy logic control system tailored for fish drying, capable of detecting rain and adjusting drying parameters in real-time to ensure optimal drying outcomes regardless of weather conditions.

**Objectives:**

- Develop a smart fish dryer with a fuzzy logic-based rain detection system.
- Assess the effectiveness of the fuzzy logic control system design.

## Significance of the Study:
- **Small-scale Fisheries (SSF):** This research can benefit the SSF community, where over 90% of people rely on fishing for their livelihoods. Specifically, it addresses issues in the dried fish industry, offering solutions to improve socio-economic conditions and ecological sustainability.
- **Dried Fish Owners/Vendors:** The study provides dried fish owners and vendors with insights into the functionality and benefits of the rain detector system, enhancing their ability to manage their operations effectively.
- **Researchers:** This study contributes to the knowledge base by exploring the design and implementation of a fuzzy mitigation system with rain detection for fish drying, enriching researchers' understanding in this field.
- **Future Researchers:** The findings of this research serve as a valuable resource for future researchers interested in developing detection systems, offering them guidance and foundational knowledge for their studies.
